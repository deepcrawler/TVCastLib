/*!
 * ###Overview
 * From a high-level perspective, DiscoveryProvider completely abstracts the functionality of discovering services of a particular protocol (SSDP, Cast, etc). The DiscoveryProvider will pass service information to the DiscoveryManager, which will then create a DeviceService object and attach it to a ConnectableDevice object.
 *
 * ###In Depth
 * DiscoveryProvider is an abstract class that is meant to be extended. You shouldn't ever use DiscoveryProvider directly, unless extending it to provide support for another discovery protocol.
 *
 * By default, DiscoveryManager will set itself as a DiscoveryProvider's delegate. You should not change the delegate as it could cause unexpected inconsistencies within the discovery process.
 *
 * See CastDiscoveryProvider and SSDPDiscoveryProvider for implementations.
